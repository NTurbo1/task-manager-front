# Task Manager

This repository contains the frontend code for the Task Manager application. It's a pet project created for learning purposes and built using React with Vite as the project starter template. The application allows users to manage tasks efficiently, with features like task CRUD, user authentication/authorization, notification service, project management, and so on.

The project is under development right now. The back-end is also created by me in [task manager api](https://github.com/NTurbo1/task-manager) using Java 17 and Spring Boot.
